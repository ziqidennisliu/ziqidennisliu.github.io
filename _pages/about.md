        Acquiring behavioral and physiological signals through two complementary approaches:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Everyday devices</b> — repurposing built-in sensors to capture rich signals during natural interaction.</li>
          <li><b>Custom wearables</b> — designing devices that unobtrusively collect modalities beyond commodity hardware.</li>

        Transforming sensor data into user- and context-aware user-state estimates::
        <ul>
          <li><b>Interaction intent</b> — recognizing implicit goals and attention patterns for interaction applications.</li>
          <li><b>Health & cognitive states</b> — inferring physiological and psychological indicators for continuous health monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
    - title: Just-in-Time Intervention

      description: >
        Moving beyond always-on feedback by identifying, for each user and context, the precise moments when intervention is most beneficial.
        The system continuously evaluates situational cues and inferred user states to identify critical windows of need,
        then delivers personalized, context-sensitive support in both interaction and health domains.

Hi! I'm **Ziqi Liu** 刘子琦

I'm a first-year M.phil student at the [UbiquitousX Lab](https://qijiashao.github.io/team/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Qijia Shao](https://qijiashao.github.io/). Prior to HKUST, I got my B.Eng degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/en/) and [Haipeng Mi](https://www.milab.design/team-1/mi-haipeng). 

My research focuses on the synergy between AI-driven sensing and adaptive intervention. By integrating hardware and software innovations across ubiquitous devices and wearables, I design and develop closed-loop systems that tightly couple the **implicit, continuous sensing** of behavioral and physiological states with **just-in-time, context-aware interventions**.

I have gained valuable research experience in multiple esteemed labs, inlucding [the Future Lab](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Pervasive HCI Group](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University.
