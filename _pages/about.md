Hi! I'm **Ziqi Liu** 刘子琦

I'm a first-year M.phil student [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://isd.hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Qijia Shao](https://qijiashao.github.io/). Prior to HKUST, I got my B.Eng degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/en/) and [Haipeng Mi](https://www.milab.design/team-1/mi-haipeng). 

My passion lies in exploring the convergence of artificial intelligence and sensing systems to develop early detection solutions and assistive devices that offer seamless, unobtrusive support for personalized healthcare and education. I aspire to contribute to a future where AI-assisted technologies empower both the general public and medical and educational professionals.

I have gained valuable research experience in multiple esteemed labs, inlucding [the Future Lab](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Pervasive HCI Group](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, as well as [UbiquitousX Lab](https://qijiashao.github.io/team/) at HKUST.
