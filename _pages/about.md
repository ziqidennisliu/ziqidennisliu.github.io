Hi! I'm **Ziqi Liu** 刘子琦

I'm a first-year M.phil student [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://isd.hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Qijia Shao](https://qijiashao.github.io/). Prior to HKUST, I got my B.Eng degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/en/) and [Haipeng Mi](https://www.milab.design/team-1/mi-haipeng). 

My research focuses on the design and development of novel AI-driven sensing and analysis systems. These systems exploit ubiquitous user devices and wearables, integrating hardware and software innovations to enable emergent interaction modalities and implicit, continuous monitoring of user behavior and physiological states.

I have gained valuable research experience in multiple esteemed labs, inlucding [the Future Lab](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Pervasive HCI Group](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, as well as [UbiquitousX Lab](https://qijiashao.github.io/team/) at HKUST.
