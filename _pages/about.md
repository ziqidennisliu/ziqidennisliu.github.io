Hi! I'm **Ziqi Liu** or Dennis, an HCI researcher at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Haipeng Mi](https://www.milab.design/team-1/mi-haipeng) and [Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/en/). I am interested in designing and developing novel interactive systems that can help people to improve their daily life. I love the researches that are not just useful, but also cool and delightful!

I'm currently in the final year of a 4-year undergraduate interdisciplinary program called ["Intelligent Engineering and Creative Design"](https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1111/1374.htm) at Tsinghua University, with courses in EE/CS(The main part), machanics and industrial design. I'm coming to the end of my undergraduate study with a B.Eng. degree in Automation, in July 2025.

I have research experiences in [the Future Lab](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Pervasive HCI Group](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University. View my [CV](assets\pdf\CV_ziqi_liu.pdf) for more information.
