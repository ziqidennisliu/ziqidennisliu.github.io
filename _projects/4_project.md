This work is part of a collaboration project with [Mercedes-Benz, Beijing](https://group.mercedes-benz.com/careers/about-us/locations/location-detail-page-5184.html). In this project, we explored the application forms and interaction design of emerging smart materials in automotive interiors, including textile sensors, smart materials, 4D materials, and dynamic materials.  

In this work, we explored the potential application of [a new type of flexible luminescent material](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03295-8) in traditional **embroidery** techniques, as well as its possible uses in automotive cabin interactions.

## Pattern Design and Embroidery Sample

We designed three different types of patterns, including functional pattern, traditional embroidery pattern, traditional weaving pattern. Additionally, we created embroidery samples with flexible luminescent materials using traditional embroidery and weaving techniques.

## Lighting Control and Circuit Implementation

Due to the requirement of alternating high-voltage, low-current conditions, we chose to connect the flexible luminescent material in series with a field-effect transistor (FET), with an ESP32 controller to control the brightness of the threads.

## Large-Format Interior Prototype Fabrication

We designed and created a glowing embroidered decoration for the interior of a Mercedes-Benz engineering vehicle, which was then installed in the actual vehicle for an effect preview. This served as a feasibility exploration for further exploring interactive features in the future.  
Due to confidentiality agreements, the final results cannot be displayed. However, here we present some images from the design process.
