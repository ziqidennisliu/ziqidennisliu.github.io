This project is part of the wayfinding system design for the public spaces of [Xinya College, Tsinghua University](https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).  
The entire project includes the planning of the wayfinding system, icon design, and the design of wayfinding boards, among other elements. The design style seamlessly integrates with the existing environment, while the innovative form of the wayfinding boards effectively adapts to the site's needs.

## Icon Design and Visual Presentation

We simplified and abstracted the spatial functions in three ways: by using relationships between people, by utilizing typical objects, and by conveying abstract meanings.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/relation.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/stuff.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/stuff1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/abstract1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/abstract.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
</div>

Based on the icons, we have divided the content in the image into layers: the icon serves as the main element, allowing pedestrians to quickly grasp the general meaning of the wayfinding. The necessary text is placed in a smaller size in the top-left corner, to be viewed up close when further clarification of the space's specific function is needed.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/6.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Wayfinding Board Design

Considering the pedestrian pathways and the varying sizes of spaces, some wayfinding boards need to be placed on the ground, while others need to be positioned at wall corners or mounted vertically on walls. To maintain a consistent and cohesive design language across different types of wayfinding boards, we employed a dual-layer design with a base and a wayfinding board. This approach ensures both functional flexibility and visual coherence across the different placements of the boards.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/3.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Guidesystem/4.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded" %}
